### Mirajobs.com
  
Mirajobs is a free Anonymous Job Search platform for software engineers.

### The Problem

#### Questions of the day for IT guys:

* How much could you negotiate on a job offer while being unemployed and urgently needing money?
* Would it be better to consider job offers while having a "backup"?
* Do you deserve a raise? ;)

### How It Works

* Do you deserve a raise?
  * Find a better tech job or get a pay bump at your current position!
* Post an Anonymous Profile at Mirajobs.com and let top IT employers apply to you.
  * No risk for your current employment.
  * Only reveal your identity to the best proposals.
  * Get a better job or negotiate a higher salary while having a backup.
* Mirajobs is 100% free for job seekers, and will always be.

### The Algorithm

Here's some Java code: [src/com/mycareer/Career.java](src/com/mycareer/Career.java).
Hope you find it funny ;)
